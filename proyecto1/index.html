# Accesibility Testing Report: Splitwise

Automated testing using Lighthouse, Manual Testing, Assistive Technology Testing using NDA

**Issue 1: Navigation and Focus Order**

- **Description**: The tab navigation order on the Home page does not follow the DOM structure, resulting in a confusing user experience. After selecting the "Tweet" button, focus skips to elements on the right side (e.g., download links, expense buttons) instead of logically proceeding to "Add an Expense" and "Settle Debts." Additionally, the dropdown menu is skipped entirely in the tab order. Focus should move intuitively from left to right, top to bottom.

- **Location**: Home Page
- **Impact Level**: High
- **WCAG Criterion**: 2.4.3 – Focus Order (Level A)
- **Solution Recommendation**:
    - **Adjust DOM Order**: Align the HTML structure with logical tabbing sequence.
    - **Tabindex Management**: Assign `tabindex="0"` to essential interactive elements, and avoid positive tabindex values to maintain natural tab flow.
    - **CSS Adjustments**: Apply `display: none` and `visibility: hidden` to elements that should not receive focus.

**Issue 2: Focus Visibility**

- **Description**: Several interactive elements (e.g., “Splitwise,” “Control Panel” “Recent Activity,” “All Expenses,” “Add,” and username) lack visible focus indicators, which can hinder navigation for keyboard users and those relying on assistive technology.
